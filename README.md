## The Application
### This app aims to directly involve users in a brief and instructive historical quiz for testing their knowledge through a set of five strategically chosen true/false questions. The main idea is to offer an easily accessible learning experience to enable users to promptly gauge their grasp of important historical facts. The app promotes user-friendliness as it permits respondents to respond using plain boolean choices, hence avoiding complexity and emphasizing content recall.

### Once the quiz has been completed, the app computes and displays the user's score, thereby providing them with instant feedback on their performance. Further, it prompts the users to either retake the quiz in a bid to better their score or terminate the app if they want to quit. This strategy promotes repeated use along with reinforcement of learning. In brief, the app is an extremely interactive study aid and a method of encouraging individuals to learn about history in an engaging and compact form.
